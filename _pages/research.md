The collison between two chemical species can result into elastic, inelastic, and reactive collision. In the first two the events, the reactants
don't change their chemical form, whereas in the third the reactants transform to different chemical species. My research in the PhD was focused on the
theoretical study of reactive collision between atom and diatom pair. This require, solving either the classical or quantum equation of motion for the 
reaction system; the former process is called classical dynamics, and the latter is quantum dynamics.

To effectively solve these equation, requires the accurate and instantaneous calculation of potential energes (or forces) of the chemical system at different spatial configurations 
in time; generating a need to find an analytical equation. The process of finding such mathematical equation is termed as construction of potential energy surface, an important
and still evolving field of research. These problems were also explored during my PhD work.
