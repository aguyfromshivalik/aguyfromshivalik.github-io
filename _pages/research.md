<p style="text-align:justify;"> The collison between two chemical species can result into elastic, inelastic, and reactive outcomes. In the first two the events, the reactants
don't change their chemical form, whereas in the third, reactants transform to different chemical species. My PhD research was focused on the
<span style="color:red;">theoretical study of reactive collision between atom and diatom pair</span>. This require solving either the classical or quantum equations of motion for the 
reaction system, which are called classical and quantum dynamics, respectively.<br> 
To effectively solve these equations, accurate and instantaneous calculation of potential energes (or forces) of the chemical system at different spatial configurations 
in time is required, which generates a need to find an analytical equation of potential as a function of spatial configuration of system. The process of finding such mathematical equation is termed as construction of potential energy surface (PES), an important and still evolving field of research. <span style="color:red;">Construction of PES</span>using machine learning and non-machine learning methods was also explored during my PhD work.</p>
