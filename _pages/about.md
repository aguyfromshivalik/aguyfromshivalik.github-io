Ciao!ðŸ‘‹ 

I come from Simalsera, a small village on the foothills of <a href='https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Himalayas'> Himalayas</a>, and some 40 km from a little town <a href='https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kotdwar'> Kotdwara </a> in <a href='https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uttarakhand'> Uttarakhand</a>, India.
Currently, at UNiPD, I am working in the field of reaction dynamics and exploring some ML applications in Chemistry. I obtained my PhD in Theoretical Chemistry under the guidance of <a href='http://chemistry.uohyd.ac.in/~sm/'> Prof. Susanta Mahapatra</a> from University of Hyderabad, Telangana, India.
